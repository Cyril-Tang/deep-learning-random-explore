# Deep Learning: Random Explore

A set of notebooks explore deep learning related topics. 

* [An easy way to do the backward propagation math](backward_propagation_for_all/README.md): use a simple rule to derive the backward propagation for all different kinds of neural networks, such as LSTM, CNN, etc. 

* [How the LSTM's memory works?](LSTM_memory_cells/README.md): dig into the LSTM's internal states to see how it manages to generate valid XML texts. 

* [Parameter counts for popular CNN architectures](CNN_archs_param_counts/README.md)

* _To be continued ..._
