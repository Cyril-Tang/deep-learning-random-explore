# Deep Learning: Random Explore

A set of notebooks explore deep learning related topics in detail. 

* [An easy way to derive the backward propagation](backward_propagation_for_all/README.md): use one simple rule to derive the backward propagation for all different kinds of neural networks, such as LSTM and CNN. 

* [How the LSTM's memory works?](LSTM_memory_cells/README.md): dig into the LSTM's internal states to see how it manages to generate valid XML texts. 

* _To be continued ..._
